# 🌈 Minimoodle Learning Wall

A child-friendly Moodle course format that displays activities as colorful cards on a playful learning wall.

## 💡 Idea
Each Moodle activity appears as a friendly card with icons, colors, and short instructions — designed especially for young learners.

## 📁 Structure
- `templates/activity_card.mustache` → the card HTML template  
- `styles.css` → design and layout (colors, spacing, shadows)  
- later: `version.php`, `config.php`, `lang/` and `classes/` for Moodle integration
